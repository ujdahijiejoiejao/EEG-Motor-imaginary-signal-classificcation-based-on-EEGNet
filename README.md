# EEG-Motor-imaginary-signal-classificcation-based-on-EEGNet
The final project of Mingyang Gao (mg7170) in deep learning course.

The final_project.ipynb is the main code of the project. The documents in Data folder is the bci-iv-2a dataset for each volunteer. Only A01T, A03T, A09T is used in this project. The result folder is the result accuracy of the training. The code in the notebook will load those data. Because I did the project in the colab notebook environment, the path of the files in the notebook isn't correct, so the path should be changed to the correct path to run the code.
